The Constructed Word Generator

The Constructed Word Generator is a KornShell script that takes a set of rules from STDIN or a file and constructs one or more random words based on those rules. It was inspired by Curt Snyder's "romulan.c" (a C port of Star Trek author Diane Duane's BASIC program) and Jeffrey Henning's "LangMaker". The former program was written in C and had the Rihannsu phonemes hard-coded in. The latter program was written in Visual Basic for Windows. I wanted a program that did the same thing, but functioned more like a proper Unix program.
